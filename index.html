                This is a test site for in class work. I made a repository on github
                I cloned it into a folder I created for in class work/projects. I then
                created an index.html file, and using visual studio code created content.
            </p>

            <p>Using gitbash I will then git add, commit, and push the file back to 
                github.com.
            </p>
